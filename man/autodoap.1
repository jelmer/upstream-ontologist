.SH NAME
autodoap \- automatically write DOAP files for upstream projects
.SH DESCRIPTION
autodoap [\-h] [\-\-trust] [\-\-disable\-net\-access] [\-\-check] [\-\-consult\-external\-directory] [\-\-version] [path]
This tool tries to guess upstream metadata (Homepage, Contact, VCS Repository)
information for an upstream project. It does this by parsing various files in the
package, and possibly calling out to external services (unless --disable-net-access is specified).
Data is written to standard out in DOAP.
