Applications with more than a handful of user-settable options are best
configured through a combination of command line args, config files,
hard-coded defaults, and in some cases, environment variables.

Python's command line parsing modules such as argparse have very limited
support for config files and environment variables, so this module
extends argparse to add these features.
