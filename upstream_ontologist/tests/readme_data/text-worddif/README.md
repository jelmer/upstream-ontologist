Text/WordDiff version 0.09
==========================

This library's module, Text::WordDiff, is a variation on the lovely
[Text::Diff](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Text::Diff) module. Rather than
generating traditional line-oriented diffs, however, it generates
word-oriented diffs. This can be useful for tracking changes in narrative
documents or documents with very long lines. To diff source code, one is still
best off using Text::Diff. But if you want to see how a short story changed
from one version to the next, this module will do the job very nicely.
