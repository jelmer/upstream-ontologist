aiozipkin is Python 3.6+ module that adds distributed tracing capabilities
from asyncio applications with zipkin (http://zipkin.io) server instrumentation.

zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed
to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. It manages
both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkinâ€™s design is based on
the Google Dapper paper.

Applications are instrumented with  aiozipkin report timing data to zipkin.
The Zipkin UI also presents a Dependency diagram showing how many traced
requests went through each application. If you are troubleshooting latency
problems or errors, you can filter or sort all traces based on the
application, length of trace, annotation, or timestamp.
