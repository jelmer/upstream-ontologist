django-ical is a simple library/framework for creating
iCal
feeds based in Django's
syndication feed framework.

This documentation is modeled after the documentation for the syndication feed
framework so you can think of it as a simple extension.

If you are familiar with the Django syndication feed framework you should be
able to be able to use django-ical fairly quickly. It works the same way as
the Django syndication framework but adds a few extension properties to
support iCalendar feeds.

django-ical uses the icalendar library
under the hood to generate iCalendar feeds.
