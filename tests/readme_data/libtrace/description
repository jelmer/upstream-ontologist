This directory contains source code for libtrace, a userspace library for
processing of network traffic capture from live interfaces or from offline
traces.

libtrace was primarily designed for use with the real-time interface to the
Waikato DAG Capture Point software running at The University of Waikato,
and has been since extended to a range of other trace and interface formats.

In version 4.0, we have introduced an API for processing packets in parallel
using multiple threads. See libtrace_parallel.h for a detailed description
of the API.
